// Test summary for media file upload integration

## Backend API (/src/app/api/posts/route.ts) ✅

- ✅ Handles POST requests for creating posts
- ✅ Expects `mediaUrls` array in request body
- ✅ Creates post record in `posts` table
- ✅ Creates media file records in `mediaFiles` table within transaction
- ✅ Supports all media types: image, video, carousel, text_only
- ✅ Properly authenticated with requireAuth middleware

## Upload API (/src/app/api/upload/route.ts) ✅

- ✅ Handles file uploads to /public/uploads/{userId}/
- ✅ Validates file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP4, MOV)
- ✅ Validates file size (10MB limit)
- ✅ Returns file URL for use in posts
- ✅ Properly authenticated

## Frontend Components ✅

### MediaUpload Component (/src/components/posts/MediaUpload.tsx)

- ✅ Accepts files via drag & drop or file picker
- ✅ Uploads files immediately to /api/upload
- ✅ Returns UploadedFile objects with URLs
- ✅ Handles upload errors gracefully
- ✅ Supports multiple files for carousel posts

### Post Form Hook (/src/hooks/use-post-form.ts)

- ✅ Manages form state with UploadedFile[] for mediaFiles
- ✅ Auto-updates mediaType based on file count
- ✅ Validates required fields
- ✅ Handles form errors

### New Post Page (/src/app/dashboard/posts/new/page.tsx)

- ✅ Integrates MediaUpload component
- ✅ Extracts URLs from uploaded files
- ✅ Sends mediaUrls to API in all handlers:
  - handleSaveDraft()
  - handleSchedulePost()
  - handlePublishNow()
- ✅ Shows uploaded file count in preview

## Data Flow ✅

1. User selects files → MediaUpload component
2. Files uploaded immediately → /api/upload → Returns URLs
3. URLs stored in form state → UploadedFile[]
4. Form submission → Extract URLs → Send to /api/posts
5. Backend creates post + media file records → Database

## Database Schema ✅

- ✅ posts table: stores post metadata
- ✅ mediaFiles table: stores file URLs and metadata
- ✅ Foreign key relationship: mediaFiles.postId → posts.id
- ✅ Transaction ensures data consistency

## Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅

The media file upload integration is complete and working correctly.
Files are uploaded immediately and stored in the database when posts are created.
